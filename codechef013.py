"""
You are given an integer N.

Print a permutation P of [1,2,…,N] such that the following condition holds:

For any index (1≤i<N), Pi × Pi+1 is not a perfect square.
If there are multiple correct answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A permutation of [1,2,…,N] is a rearrangement of those numbers.

Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the length of the required permutation.
Output Format
For each test case, print N space-separated integers representing the valid permutation on a single line.

If there are multiple correct answers, you may print any of them.
